# Vote-the-6ix

With the NBA All-Star Game being held in Toronto this year, we need to ensure our city is represented by voting Kyle Lowry 
and Demar Derozan into the game.  However, despite the numerous methods to vote, people are still sometimes too lazy to vote
for their hometown players.  Vote-the-6ix is a Chrome extension that allows the user to vote for Kyle Lowry and Demar Derozan 
via twitter in three simple clicks.  All you have to do is choose which player you want to vote for, and the extension generates
a tweet with their name and #NBAVote.  Either submit that tweet right away, or customize the tweet to your liking.  Help ensure the Toronto Raptors are represented by their best players at the All-Star game!

Tech Specs:

* Javascript function running on basic HTML page
* Uses twitter API to generate the tweet
